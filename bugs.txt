1. syntax errors like >>> should not create a new file called '>'
	this error occur with "<<" and ">>"
	this is how it should work:
	$ <<<
	bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
	$ <<<<
	bash: syntax error near unexpected token `<'

2. Echo should be fixed when using ^C with it.
	$ cat "
	>
	>
	> ^C
	>
	(It should stop the command)

3. Exit command with different arguments.
	the exit status should change if there is more than 1 arg with the exit
	or if there is a non numerical value with the args

4. Exit status should be fixed.
	some other exit status here and there are not 100% correct

5. Signals inside heredoc.
	in all cases ^\ should be ignore (even out of here doc)
	^C should quit here doc and return to prompt
	^D should quit here doc print error message and return to prompt

6. Export with quotes.
	All those tests should be working fine
	$ export a=b
	$ export "c"=d
	$ export "e"="f"
	$ export g="h"
